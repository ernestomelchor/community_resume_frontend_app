The Challenge:

Our challenge was to design and build the frontend to a community resume app using a microservices design architecture. This repo would ultimately connect to a backend designed and built by a separate backend team. We were under a tight timeline and had two days to work on this project.

Our Problem-Solving Approach:

We spoke to the backend team about using dummy data in the meantime to setup our frontend. After confirming with the backend, we got to work on the design and layout of our Single Page Application (SPA). We worked diligently to prevent merging conflicts using Git and each team member cloned this repo to add features to the site.

What We Learned:

We often found ourselves wanting to move quicker so we could add nice-to-have features but instead decided to allocate our time to building the must-have features. It involved a process of sefl-reflection and giving each other constructive feedback so we could drive results. It helped tremendously to keep an open mind and the team focused on building that from the beginning which led to a better experience overall.
